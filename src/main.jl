    sim!(P::Vector{TN}, C::Vector{TS}, dt::Float32) where {TN <: AbstractNeuron, TS<:AbstractSynapse }

Simulates the spiking neural network by iterating over the populations and synapses in the network and updating their states.

**Arguments**
- `P::Vector{TN}`: Vector of neurons in the network.
- `C::Vector{TS}`: Vector of synapses in the network.
- `dt::Float32`: Time step for the simulation.

**Details**
- The function then calls the `integrate!` function on `p` with its parameters and the time step `dt`.
- Finally, the function calls the `record!` function on `p` to record its state.

- For each synapse `c` in `C`, the function checks if `c` has a field `t` and increments its value by 1 if it exists.
- The function then calls the `forward!` function on `c` with its parameters.
- Finally, the function calls the `record!` function on `c` to record its state.

Simulates the spiking neural network for a specified duration by repeatedly calling `sim!` function.

**Arguments**
- `P::Vector{TN}`: Vector of neurons in the network.
- `C::Vector{TS}`: Vector of synapses in the network.
- `dt::Float32`: Time step for the simulation. Default value is `0.1f0`.
- `duration::Float32`: Duration of the simulation. Default value is `10.0f0`.
- `pbar::Bool`: Flag indicating whether to display a progress bar during the simulation. Default value is `false`.

**Details**
- The function creates a range of time steps from `0.0f0` to `duration-dt` with a step size of `dt`.
- If `pbar` is `true`, the function creates a progress bar using the `ProgressBar` function with the time step range. Otherwise, it uses the time step range directly.
- The function iterates over the time steps and calls the `sim!` function with `P`, `C`, and `dt`.
